# MetMast visualization and analysis toolbox
Python package for loading filtering and visualizing data produced by the met masts at the National Wind Technology Center (NWTC) part of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. 

## Getting Started
The following codebase is developed in Python 3.6 and makes heavy use of numpy, matplotlib, and pandas. Wind rose figures also require the python-windrose package available at https://github.com/python-windrose/windrose.

## Required packages
numpy - used to structure data into arrays, perform basic operations, etc.
matplotlib - used in flow visualization
pandas - dataframes, series, grouping, etc
windrose - wind rose figures

## Prerequisites
Python 3.6 - working knowledge

## Installing
Download or clone git repo. Go to town.
